Abandoned Bricks

Instalation instructions

If you downloaded the Windows setup.exe just run it and follow the
instructions. It's a good idea to first uninstall any existing
instalation on Abandoned Bricks.

If you downloaded the Windows binary (zip file),
just unpack to some directory and run ab.exe.

If you downloaded the Linux binary (tar.gz file), unpack to some
directory and run ./abrick. If you wish you can "install" it with:
"make install" option. After that, you can run the game just by typing abrick
anywhere. You may have to check which version on SDL library you have and,
if the game doesn't work, download the latest version.
This version of Abandoned Bricks is compiled against SDL version 1.2.5.

If the game runs too slow, try running it with "Abandoned Bricks -h".

If you downloaded the source code, you must have the development versions of
the following libraries installed:
SDL
SDL_mixer (optional for music/sfx)

If you don't, you can get it at:
http://www.libsdl.org

When ready, unpack the source to any folder, and run:
make

It uses sdl-config for configuration options, so you shouldn't have any
problems. This makefile uses g++ on GNU/Linux.

File makefile.b32 is makefile for Borland's Free C++ Compiler (BCC). Follow the
instructions on www.libsdl.org website to create development environment
for BCC, edit the makefile to fit your paths and run:
make -f makefile.b32

Other compilers aren't supported, but feel free to try: just compile all
.cpp files and link. If your system is supported by SDL library,
it should work. It should work on MacOSX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
