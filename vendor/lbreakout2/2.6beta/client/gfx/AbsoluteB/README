* Description

New version of the theme, well, it has changed a lot since the previous version,
and looks more consistent now.
The menu background, the in-game frame, the bricks , paddles, weapons, backgrounds and extras have been customized.
As you will notice , I modified some of the original backgrounds a bit, and created new ones, all using the Gimp. Hopefully you'll enjoy this theme.
