o Added arrow keys for undo/redo.
o Changed behaviour of button clicking, so there is no indication of which
  tiles are movable anymore. Clicking on the first tile highlights it until
  it is clocked on again or a matching tile is clicked on, then they both
  vanish. My wife has trouble seeing the highlighted tiles though...
o Began working on touching up the artwork...
o Used gettimeofday() to randomize the game.
