PSPMediaCenter by John_K & adresd
=================================

v0.5b - June 23 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Currently plays MP3s, MODs and partially OGGs (they jitter).
Uses libMad, Tremor and adresd's MOD code.

Place media files in /PSP/MUSIC but not in a subdir.
For MODs, only .mod will work. AHX support is in the works.

only 44khz files are currently supported, although others may partially work.
