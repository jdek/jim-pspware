 CHANGES
---------

  >> (Short for PSP Dev. 1)
 + Merged the uo_Snes9x 0.02y11J3a5 codebase.
 + Compressing and Decompressing save states
   now preserves the original file timestamp.
 + The battery info is now printed in English.
 + The 'Fit' screen mode becomes 4:3 when the
   sceGu blit backend is enabled.
 + The Makefile will use dependencies again.
  >> If you get an error about missing the
     "dependencies" file, then `make depend`.
 + The Makefile will automatically build the
   dependencies if not present.
 + Links against psplibc instead of libc now.
  >> newlib's libc has VERY slow file I/O.
 + Reverted back to unziplib, because it has
   a much needed progress callback.

     progress callback to the official Snes9x
     unzip code.

 
 ADDITIONS

     and make others worse.
 + Added clear_execute_bit (...) to clear a
   file's execute attrib and modes.

   invoke kxploit on EBOOT.PBP.
