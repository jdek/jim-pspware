 CHANGES
---------
 + SceGU is now double buffered.
 + For the 1x display mode using SceGU, a new
   optimization is used that triples the RAM
   to VRAM transfer rate.
 + Moved the old "Show Debug Info" option from
   the Display Config to the new Debugger menu.
 + The Snes9x error handler is MUCH more
   advanced now.
  >> It displays relevant config options and
     also offers to display callstack info now.
 + Yoshi's Island runs now, although extremely
   slowly :)
 + Misc. changes required for Snes9x to compile
   with the latest PSP SDK.


 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Added a new debugger menu where you can sim-
   ulate crashes to test the error handler code
   and display system info.
  >> Give the Segmentation Fault crash simulator
     a whirl. Aside from having to restart the
     program, nothing bad will happen.


 BUG FIXES
-----------
 + Fixed several issues related to exiting the
   game using the Home button.
 + The Snes9x icon is once again packed into
   the final PBP.

-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + Translated the Key Config menu to English.
 + Cleaned up the code in psp.cpp


 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Added a file manager
  >> It's designed so you can copy/move ALL
     files on your Memory Stick and even
     from one Memory Stick to another.


 KNOWN ISSUES
--------------
 + On occasion, the framebuffer will refuse
   to cooperate and expect the wrong pixel
   format.
  >> If this happens to you, exit the emu-
     lator completely and load it again.

-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + The left and right triggers truly scroll
   down to the next page now.
 + Translated the ROM Selector's Delete
   Confirmation dialog to English.
 + Thoroughly cleaned the SceGU blit backend
   code and made it conform with the Snes9x
   standards.
  >> This was in preperation for the work I'm
     planning to do in pd3.
    * The tile drawing code is the biggest
      bottleneck in the PSP port right now.
 + Stopped calling SceGU sceGu :)
  >> It made a couple of functions hard to
     read, so I decided to follow suit and
     mimic OpenGL since SceGU seems to.


 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Added file size info to the ROM selector.
 + Added support for zlib compression.
  >> This is intended to replace the old RLE
     compression. Support for RLE will remain,
     however, so you can convert your old save
     state files.


 BUG FIXES
-----------
 + Fixed a bug that was causing transparency to
   be enabled everytime you loaded a ROM, with
   no regard to your saved preference.

-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + Removed VAR_CYCLES from the Makefile, there
   hasn't been a VAR_CYCLES codepath since the
   release of Snes9x 1.41.
 + Removed the socklen stuff from the Makefile.
  >> That's only used by the server code, and
     the PSP port doesn't use that.
   
   
 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Because the PSP toolchain lacks support for
   gprof, I had to write my own ad-hoc profiler
   code.
  >> It's disabled by default, but to enable it,
     add USE_PROFILER and PROFILE_TILES and/or
     PROFILE_GFX to the defines and rebuild
     tile.o, gfx.o and psp/psp.o.
 + When profiling is enabled, you can use the
   "hold" switch to toggle it on/off.
  >> NOTE: It doesn't work in the menu and to
           turn it back on/off, you have to move
	   the switch from the on position to
	   the hold position (can't go from hold
	   to on).

 CHANGES
---------
 + Integrated most of y's hackish optimizations
   from y28.
  >> As a result, some games will no longer run.
     I will undo the optimizations that break
     things shortly, be patient until then.
 + The Makefile now removes the Snes9x bin and
   EBOOT.PBP files in the clean rule.
 + Games that run with 239 scanlines no
   longer have the bottom cut off in 4:3
   and Full modes using sceGu.
 + The position of the viewport in Normal mode
   when using sceGu is now based on the number
   of scanlines the game uses.
 + Changed the sceGu blit code so that the
   unrendered portions of the texture will be
   clipped.
  >> This is esspecially handy for HiRes mode.


 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Added projected battery life stats.
 

 BUG FIXES
-----------
 + Fixed a bug in filer.c that was causing
   directories to be ignored in the ROM sel-
   ector.
 + Corrected the reported battery charge %.



Andon (15/Jul/05)
-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + sceGu is now the default blit backend.
 + Bilinear filtering is now enabled by def-
   ault.
 + The default screen mode is now 4:3 / Fit.
 + The sceGu blit code now calls
   sceKernelDcacheWritebackAll (...) before
   writing to a texture.
  >> This makes sure that there are no cache
     issues when blitting.
 + The CPU clock is temporarily rev'd up to
   333 MHz when loading ROMs and state saves.
  >> Previously, they'd typically run at 222
     MHz.
 + The dirty framebuffer clear code now diff-
   erentiates between sceGu and pg blitting.



Andon (15/Jul/05)
-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + pgGetVramAddr (...) will now ignore the
   state of pg_drawframe when GU blitting is
   selected.
 + The menu is always drawn using pg blitting
   now.
 + The main menu is redrawn even while a child
   menu is open now.
 + The Makefile will automatically build the
   dependencies if not present.
   


Andon (15/Jul/05)
-----------------
 CHANGES
---------
 + Changed the version string to 0.02pd1
  >> (Short for PSP Dev. 1)
 + Merged the uo_Snes9x 0.02y11J3a5 codebase.
 + Compressing and Decompressing save states
   now preserves the original file timestamp.
 + The battery info is now printed in English.
 + The 'Fit' screen mode becomes 4:3 when the
   sceGu blit backend is enabled.
 + The Makefile will use dependencies again.
  >> If you get an error about missing the
     "dependencies" file, then `make depend`.
 + Links against psplibc instead of libc now.
  >> newlib's libc has VERY slow file I/O.
 + Reverted back to unziplib, because it has
   a much needed progress callback.
  >> If anyone needs something to do, add a
     progress callback to the official Snes9x
     unzip code.

 
 ADDITIONS
-----------
 + Added this CHANGELOG, for pspdev changes.
 + Added Bit Blit Backend to the display config
   menu.
  >> GU doesn't work very well, so you can turn
     it on/off during runtime for testing...
     * Your preference will be saved on a
       per-game basis.
 + Added options for the GU blit filter
   technique and HiRes mode to the display
   config menu.
 + Added a Sample Decode option to the sound
   config menu.
  >> This will make some games sound better,
     and make others worse.
 + Added clear_execute_bit (...) to clear a
   file's execute attrib and modes.
  >> The sce API requires new files to be
     created using 0777, so call this after
     you write a file if you don't want it
     to be executable.
 + Added a kxploit Makefile rule, which will
   invoke kxploit on EBOOT.PBP.
  >> Assumes you have your PSP mounted as
     '/mnt/PSP'.
