  "FRAGS: In a pingpong level (no bricks) a player gains a frag everytime "

  " packets. This should not be too high to prevent network flooding. 40 is a good value.#"

  "PINGPONG:#"
  "The point here is to play it fast and to use all of your balls. "
  "Use the right and left mouse button to fire the balls "
  "while moving the paddle. Your opponent "
  "will have trouble to reflect all balls if you do it right. "
  "If you are not sure wether you got balls left click anyway. "
  "Keep the button pressed for a while! The fire rate is restricted "
  "to one ball every 500 milliseconds.##" 
  "NORMAL:#"
  "Your goal here is too gain more score than your opponent to win a "
  "round. Basically you do this by clearing bricks and collecting extras "
  "but there are some other ways as well:#"
  "1) To loose a ball means to loose 10% score. After five seconds penalty "
  "a new ball is created and you can continue playing.#"
  "2) Hitting your opponents paddle with the plasma weapon will give you "
  "1000 points while stealing him/her the same amount.#"
  "3) Bonus/malus magnet will attract _all_ bonuses/maluses even those "
  "released by your opponent.##"
  "Note: If you pause the game by pressing 'p' a chat will pop up and you "
  "can talk to your opponent.",
  "You cannot offer someone your levelset unless this user "
  "wants to receive your set which requires the following steps:#"
  "1) select the user to whom you want to listen#"
  "2) press the 'L' button above the levelset list#"
  "3) wait for offer or cancel 'listening'#"
  "The receiver is now ready and the sender has to:#"
  "1) select the listening user#"
  "2) select the levelset (s)he wants to transfer#"
  "3) hit the 'T' button above the levelset list#"
  "If the receiver has this levelset already located in "
  "~/.lgames/lbreakout2-levels and it is up-to-date the transfer "
  "does not take place otherwise the receiver is asked to confirm "
  "and if (s)he does so the set is transferred to the home "
  "directory and directly available if intended for network. (starts with 'MP_')#"
  "NOTE: Only the challenger is required to have the levelset so you "
  "don not have to transfer sets to play with someone. However if your opponent "
  "likes your set and wants to challenge others with it both can engage into "
  "a transfer."
