This is a version of the game "Trailblazer" which I believe
originated on the Commodore 16. It is quite a simple game,
the idea being to get to the end of the level - of which there are 14.

Different colour tiles have different effects - I leave it to you to
discover what :)

It's pretty basic and poorly constructed - it's really just me playing
with the SDL Library.

Playing
-------
Keys are Z and X for steering, K and M for accelerate / slow down,
and L to jump. There are a limited number of jumps per level.

ESC to exit.

Install
-------
untar the archive in a directory
run "make" to make the code. You will need a recent version of SDL (built with 1.2.3)
run "make install" to install it - it creates some files in /usr/share/trailblazer
