PSPMediaCenter by John_K & adresd
=================================

v0.84 - July 12 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------
Reworked the extension handling, to allow more than one extension per codec.
STSound and MikMod Library Support added.

v0.83 - July 5 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------
Added timer display to decoders, and to debug gui lib.

v0.82 - July 3 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed OGG crashing at end of file
Made OGGs loop
Cleaned up OGG printfs
Fixed slight ommission when adresd changed makefile to use build.mak in v0.79 (added -G0 to CFLAGS)

v0.81 - July 3 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Re-organisation to split the gui's into configurable options.
This allows a debug version for audio codecs, and a debug one
for video codecs, as well as the 'full' nice interface for 
release builds.

v0.80 - July 3 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Added a base XM player.

v0.79 - July 2 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed up to build with new pspsdk setup.
Left and Right top buttons now do previous/next tune when playing.
Left and Right d-pad goes up/down 10 tunes in the playlist view.
Ogg seems slightly broken, investigating. So using old compile at moment.

v0.71 - June 27 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
44kHz OGG Decoding fixed
AAC code added. Not working yet.
new toolchain / PSPSDK broke libTremor just after we fixed it, OGG no longer works at all

v0.7 - June 25 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Added AHX support
For this version, codec config moved to 'codec.conf' so player app doesnt
need to be changed to add/remove codecs.



v0.5b - June 23 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Currently plays MP3s, MODs and partially OGGs (they jitter).
Uses libMad, Tremor and adresd's MOD code.

Place media files in /PSP/MUSIC but not in a subdir.
For MODs, only .mod will work. AHX support is in the works.

only 44khz files are currently supported, although others may partially work.
