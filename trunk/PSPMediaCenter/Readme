PSPMediaCenter by John_K & adresd
=================================

v0.7 - June 25 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Currently plays MP3s, AHXs, MODs and partially OGGs (they jitter).
Uses libMad, Tremor and adresd's MOD code.

For this version, codec config moved to 'codec.conf' so player app doesnt
need to be changed to add/remove codecs.

Place media files in /PSP/MUSIC but not in a subdir.
For MODs, only .mod will work. For AHX, only .ahx will work.

only 44khz files are currently supported, although others may partially work.
