Writing Lua software for PSP
============================
Lua is an interpreted language. This means that all applications are distributed in source form, which in turn means that you can look at other people's code. Just go to the Applications folder, and then look at the index.lua inside the applications. There's also documentation inside the doc/ folder, and a 'samples' folder.


Obtaining the source
============================
% svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/pspware/trunk/LuaPlayer


Function reference
