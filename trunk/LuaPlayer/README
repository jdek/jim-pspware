Install on PSP

Create PSP/GAME/luaplayer/, and place the eboot.psp, Library, and 
Applications folder in there. See the Applications folder for examples.

It's not recommended that you distribute your own game with the luaplayer binaries without Lowser. If you really want to, note that the default script has been changed from "script.lua" to "Library/system.lua".
