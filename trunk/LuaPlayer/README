Lua Player
by Shine and Nevyn


Requirements

  zlib, libpng, liblua, liblualib, mikmodlib


Build

  make
  make kxploit (if you have firmware 1.5)


Install on PSP

Create PSP/GAME/luaplayer/, and place the eboot.psp, script.lua, and 
Applications folder in there. See the Applications folder for examples.

If you want to distribute your own game with the luaplayer binaries without 
Lowser (though not recommended), do as above, but do not add the Applications 
folder, and add your own script instead of the bundled script.lua. See the 
samples/snake folder for an example of this scenario
