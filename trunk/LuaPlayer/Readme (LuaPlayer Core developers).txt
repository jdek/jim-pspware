Contributing code to the LuaPlayer project
============================
If you want to help out with writing code for the LuaPlayer project, you're reading the right file. Lots of work needs to be done before LP can be considered stable. There's a bunch of undocumented bugs all over the place, for example.

Current maintainers are Frank 'Shine' Buß (fb@frankbuss.de) and Joachim 'Nevyn' Bengtsson (joachimb@gmail.com).

You're welcome to submit code patches, ideas and bug reports to http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewforum.php?f=21 .
