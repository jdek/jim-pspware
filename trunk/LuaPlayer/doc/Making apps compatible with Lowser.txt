Making your app play nicely with Lowser is very simple.
1. The main script file should be called "index.lua". Place it, with all its resources in a folder with the application's name (spaces and everything is allowed; make the name nice: "Foobar's Magical Quest", not "foobar_game")
2. Instruct your downloaders to install your game in memorystick:/PSP/GAME/luaplayer/Applications/ . 
3. Make your game *exitable*, please. Just make sure that the end of the file is reachable. (Your main loop could look something like this:

while not Controls.read():start() do
	[ your app's code ]
end)
