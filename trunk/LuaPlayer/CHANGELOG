v0.20
==========
 - enhanced Windows support by InsertWittyName

v0.20
==========
 - updated for gcc 4.1 and Lua 5.1. Some things you need to change for 5.1:
    - change table iteration code:
      "for i, value in someTable do" to
      "for i, value in ipairs(someTable) do"
      (but use "pairs" for tables like "t={foo=bar, foobar=99}"
       and "ipairs" for tables like "t={foo, bar}")
    - it's pure Lua 5.1: no binary operators and double as number type
      (e.g. now you can use one number for storing IP addresses)
 - Sound.load doesn't crash any more on invalid filenames
 - fixed problems with daylight saving time
 - Font:getTextSize fixed. Test case:
    proportional = Font.createProportional()
    proportional:setPixelSizes(0,8) 
    test = proportional:getTextSize('some text')
    assert(test.width == 39)
    assert(test.height == 6)
 - blit operation from screen to image works now, e.g.:
     screen:print(10, 10, "hello", Color.new(255,255,255))
     image = Image.createEmpty(480, 272)
     image:blit(0, 0, screen, 480, 272, 480, 272, true)
   and now you have an "image" with the text "hello"
 - TTF font plotting to images now sets the alpha value to opaque, so
   you can write e.g. something like this for buffering texts in images:
     image = Image.createEmpty(400, 200)
     proportional = Font.createProportional()
     proportional:setPixelSizes(0, 16)
     image:fontPrint(proportional, 0, 20, 'Hello', Color.new(0, 255, 0))
     screen:blit(0, 0, image)
     screen:blit(3, 3, image)
 - new function Image.loadFromMemory for loading images from memory:
     jpegFile = io.open("test.jpg", "rb")
     data = jpegFile:read("*a")
     jpegFile:close()
     image = Image.loadFromMemory(data)
   PNG and JPEG is supported and autodetected
 - image-to-image blitting now uses alpha full blending [Callum Bethune]
 - System.rename(oldName, newName) for renaming files and directories

v0.19
==========
 - directory detection bugfix [moonlight]
 - Changed System.loadModule to loadlib to work. [Oobles]
   the same as the traditional lua loadlib function.
 - Made loadlib check if a module is already loaded before trying
   to load. [Oobles]
 - Removed getLuaState export. No longer required. [Oobles]
 - Made debugOutput work in the same way as printf in bootstrap. [Oobles]
 - Added loadlib.prx kernel module. required for module loading. [Oobles]
 - Added a module sample for manipulating images [Shine]

v0.18alpha (blame Oobles for all changes)
================================================
 - Moved all kernel dependant code into bootstrap code.
 - Moved all of luaplayer into a user mode prx module.
 - Removed the stdio redirection.
 - Made runScript return its error message to main.
 - Exported all lua functions from luaplayer module.
 - Made debugOutput work in the same was as printf.
 - Added System.loadModule function to dynamically load LRX modules.
 - Added an example simple.lrx module as template.
 - Changed Makefiles to support new bootstrap code.
 - Added an example sound.lrx module which moves all sound out
   of main luaplayer.  In theory could remove it completely from
   luaplayer and load it only when required.  Same could apply
   for other modules.

v0.17
==========
 - Wlan.useConnectionConfig bugfix: doesn't lock up anymore on error [Elxx]

v0.16 (all changes for this version by Shine)
================================================
 - Wlan:getIPAddress bugfix: now it returns nil on error and the
   IP address otherwise
 - DNS resolving. Now you can write
   Socket.connect("www.luaplayer.org", 80) instead of
   Socket.connect("212.227.39.202", 80),
   thanks to ideas how to use the resolver lib from PSPRadio
 - when loading JPEGs, the file was not closed
 - System.md5sum bugfixing for the Windows version
 - Wlan.useConnectionConfig index is 1 based instead of 0 based, like usual in Lua
 - System.powerTick added: this prevents power off, now you can nail
   your PSP on a wall for your electronic painting :-)
 - System.createDirectory, System.removeDirectory and System.removeFile added

v0.15
==========
 - timer bug fixed (was bug in PSPSDK) [mrbrown]
 - wlan socket support (based on PspPet's "WiFi Multi-Test .03") [Shine]
 - changed sceGu* and sceGum* functions to Gu.* and Gum.* [Shine]
 - System.getFreeMemory added [Shine]

 - Windows Emulator [sweetlilmre]
     sceIoD* functionality added for System.listDirectory().
     sceGuClearColor and sceGuClear implemented.
     flicker reduction via GL / PSP drawing sync
     attempt to improve sound sync by yeilding in glutIdleFunc() func.
 - possible signed bug for timer fixed [Shine]

v0.13
==========
 - screen:clear bugfix (was always black) [Shine]
 - updated Windows version with sound [sweetlilmre]

 - initial GU mapping [Shine]

v0.11 (all changes for this version by Shine)
================================================
 - Added System.md5sum and filelist.txt debug ouput on startup failure in boot.lua
 - changed case sensitivity handling in boot.lua for problems with Windows 98
 - now Image.createEmpty accepts 512x512 pixel sizes
 - internal image width and height needs not to be the same size
 - max image size can be 512x512 now (larger are not allowed with GU blit)
 - System.sioInit, sioWrite and sioRead implemented for serial port support
   (see http://www.luaplayer.org/sio/readme.html and http://nil.rpc1.org/psp/remote.html
    for information about the hardware interface)
 - new Timer class and System.sleep function
 - fixed timezone bug
 - moved Starfield and SIO Echo example to Applications

v0.10
==========
 - Added the "Bitwise operators and hexadecimal support" patch from
   http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaPowerPatches :
        - Hexadecimal support for 0xXXX in numeric literals. 
        - Hexadecimal support for '\xXX' characters within strings. 
        - Infix bitwise operators for AND (&), OR (|) and XOR (#). 
        - Unary bitwise negation using # alone.  [Shine]
 - Changed the number type to float (more than 4 times faster calculations) 
   (requires recompilation of the lua libraries from svn) [Shine]
 - "save" function writes PNG format now [Shine]
 - Restructured files into src/ [Nevyn]
 - Changed the main script file to System/system.lua [Nevyn]
 - Rewrote the Makefiles and readmes to be more user-friendly.  [Nevyn]

 - bitmask operations added in controls class [Shine]
