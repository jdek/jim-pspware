v0.10
==========
 - Added the "Bitwise operators and hexadecimal support" patch from
   http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaPowerPatches :
        - Hexadecimal support for 0xXXX in numeric literals. 
        - Hexadecimal support for '\xXX' characters within strings. 
        - Infix bitwise operators for AND (&), OR (|) and XOR (#). 
        - Unary bitwise negation using # alone. 
 - Changed the number type to float (more than 4 times faster calculations)
 - "save" function writes PNG format now
 - Restructured files into src/
 - Changed the main script file to "system.lua", to enforce the idea
   that apps should be using Lowser and not bundle their own eboots.
 - Rewrote the Makefile
