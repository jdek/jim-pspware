Egg Chess v1.1 (010910) by Anders Lindström
============================================

1. Intro

This is free software (GNU GPL), read COPYING for details.

This is a very simple game called Egg Chess (or in swedish: Äggaschack).


1.1 Rules

Player 1 places an egg - whole, half eaten or empty - in one of the nine 
nests. Next, player 2 can place a new egg (or part thereof), eat a part
of the existing egg or eat the whole existing egg. Next, player 1 does the 
same.
The winner is the player who gets three whole, half eaten or empty eggs in 
a row.


2. Installation

First you need SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/ (v1.2+). After
installing SDL, don't forget to check that the dynamic linker can find it 
(check /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig).

This game also uses SGE from http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~e8cal1/sge/index.html,
but a version of SGE is included with the game.

Just do 'make' to compile the game. The binary (eggchess) can be placed 
anywhere as long as the directory gfx/ is in the same place.

Egg chess supports cross compiling from Linux to Win32.


3. Credits
The rules of the game is invented by Stefan Sandstrom. Some of the graphics
are borrowed from the Mac game "MacÄggaschack".
