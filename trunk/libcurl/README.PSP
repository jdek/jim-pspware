This is a port of libcurl 7.15.1 for the PSP, based originally on danzel's patches but 
I have cleaned them up, in part because I added gethostbyname/addr to newlib itself.

To build configure the source with:

LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/pspdev/psp/lib -L/usr/local/pspdev/psp/sdk/lib" \
		 LIBS="-lc -lpspnet_inet -lpspnet_resolver -lpspuser" \
		 ./configure --host=psp --disable-shared --prefix=/usr/local/pspdev/psp

The just make; make install.
