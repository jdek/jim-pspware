<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score. Shapes
fall from the top of the screen. You can move them sideways and rotate them in order to get the best fit when
they reach the bottom. When you manage to complete a horizontal line, it disappears. When screen is full the
game is over. The game speeds up whenever the lines are full. Therefore, it's better to fill as many lines
you can at once. That way you can reach higher levels with the same speed.
<br><br>For single player game there are three game modes. In <b>Classic</b> mode you start each level with
clean screen. You get one point for each brick and: <br><br>
<ul>
 <li> 5 points for one line</li>
 <li>20 points for two lines at once</li>
 <li>45 points for three lines at once</li>
 <li>80 points for four lines at once</li>
</ul>
<br>
In <b>Challenge</b> mode you start levels with some garbage at bottom, and you only have
two brick types (shapes) for the level. You get 3 points for each brick, but lower
bonuses for lines:<br><br>
<ul>
 <li> 3 points for one line</li>
 <li>12 points for two lines at once</li>
 <li>27 points for three lines at once</li>
 <li>48 points for four lines at once</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
In <b>Bastet</b> mode you start levels with clean screen. You always get the worst possible brick for
the moment, and next brick preview is not available. You get 20 points for each brick, and high
bonuses for lines:<br><br>
<ul>
 <li>100 points for one line</li>
 <li>400 points for two lines at once</li>
 <li>900 points for three lines at once</li>
 <li>1600 points for four lines at once</li>
</ul>
<br>
Bastet mode is based on the <a href="http://fph.altervista.org/prog/bastet.shtml">Bastet</a> game by
Federico Poloni. The algorithm is taken from Bastet 0.41. To quote: <i> Bastet does not choose your
next brick at random.  Instead, Bastet uses a special algorithm designed to choose the worst brick possible.
As you can imagine, playing Bastet can be a very frustrating experience! </i><br>
<BR>
In two player games (<b>duel</b>), the goal is to remain the only one still playing. When you drop more than one line, the other
player gets additional garbage lines at the bottom. For two lines he gets one, for three he gets two and for four
he gets three (in short: what you've dropped minus one).</font><br><br>
